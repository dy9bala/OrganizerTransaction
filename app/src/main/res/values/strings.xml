        Since activities launched inside task fragment are only allowed when
        <tt>com.android.server.wm.Task#effectiveUid</tt> matches one of launched activity or
        is system uid, we\'ll need to be in task whose effectiveUid, in order to be able
        to launch arbitrary activities inside our TaskFragment.
        \nThat is checked in <tt>com.android.server.wm.ActivityStarter#canEmbedActivity</tt>

        \n\nYet, in order to create <tt>TaskFragment</tt>, uid of root <tt>ActivityRecord</tt> within <tt>Task</tt>
        must be equal to one of <tt>ActivityRecord</tt> creating <tt>TaskFragment</tt>
        \nThat is checked in <tt>com.android.server.wm.WindowOrganizerController#createTaskFragment</tt>

        \n\nThis is first step when we\'ll create <tt>Task</tt> that fulfills these conditions and
        in the end only contains <tt>SecondActivity</tt> from this app.

    <string name="hello_world_2">
        Now that we\'re in task that has <tt>effectiveUid=system</tt> and <tt>getRootTask().getUid</tt> of this app
        we can start launching activities and getting their <tt>SurfaceControl</tt>-s

        \n\nIn list below you can choose \"System settings\" to launch system settings
        and use \"Zoom and set alpha\" option to make settings application translucent and scaled.
        This is for demonstration of possible tap-jacking.

        \n\nThe second option (\"Shutdown\") will <tt>startActivity com.android.internal.app.ShutdownActivity</tt>,
        which normally requires signature permission <tt>android.permission.SHUTDOWN</tt>,
        but since activity start is actually happening under <tt>Binder.clearCallingIdentity()</tt>,
        it is allowed. This demonstrates ability to launch activities regardless of permissions
        and exported state.
